# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains five simple Python programs. Each program is standalone and demonstrates basic functionality using Python. All programs are written in Python and require **Python 3.12.6** to run.

## Programs Included:

1. **To-Do List**:
   - A simple to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks.
   - The tasks are stored in memory during the program run and can be managed through a command-line interface.
   
2. **Calculator**:
   - A basic calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Uses a simple Python GUI library (e.g., Tkinter) to provide a visual interface.

3. **Password Generator**:
   - A random password generator that allows users to generate strong passwords of varying lengths.
   - Users can choose to include uppercase, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters in their passwords.

4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**:
   - A simple text-based game where the user plays against the computer.
   - The user selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects one as well. The winner is determined based on traditional rules.

5. **Contact Book**:
   - A contact management application that allows users to add, view, and delete contacts.
   - Each contact contains information such as name, phone number, and email address.
